# Load packages -----------------------------------------------------------

# Load some packages
library(tidyverse)

library(ggpubr)

library(colorspace)
hcl_palettes(plot = TRUE) # View colour chart

# install.packages("devtools") Its commented out as it only needs to be loaded once.
# devtools::install_github('Mikata-Project/ggthemr') # Found on GitHub website https://github.com/Mikata-Project/ggthemr
library(ggthemr)

# "ggthemr could not be loaded on my version of R. 
# Therefore, I had to install the package "devtools" in order to use the 
# following command, which in turn, allowed me to load the package "ggthemr".
